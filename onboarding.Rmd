## INTERACT Onboarding

> [Remember that there is no geek gene](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006023)

The purpose of this document is orient and provide guidance for new trainees and collaborators involved with the INTERACT study. Our aim is to make your integration onto the team straight forward, action oriented, and to help you learn new skills. 

This onboarding document is divided into 4 sections: 
1. Glossary
2. R and RStudio
3. Database Connections in RStudio
4. Github

The goal is point you to existing tutorials or training that will facilitate your work. It is important to remember that you will need to follow the tutorials in detail to get your head around what you are trying to do. Along with the tutorials we will ask that you do activities specific to INTERACT. We will try our best to acknowledge the great people who have contributed to the tutorials you are completing. 

#### Thanks!

We hope that once you are done, you can confidently use the INTERACT workflow, do awesome analysis, and publish cool papers. 

## Glossary

- Programming Language
- Server
- Database
- R
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
    - An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion. You will learning R with the RStudio IDE.

### INTERACT Tasks

These are the steps you will need to follow
1. Install PostgreSQL on your system. You can find the necessary files here (https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. Install 

You will now setup the connection to the server with the data. You will need to have USask credentials and VPN access to USask. If you have USask credentials you can find information on using the VPN here (https://www.usask.ca/ict/services/network-services/vpn/mac-106-intel-vpn.php). 

**Make sure you are connected to the USask VPN**



You will need to install the following libraries:
```
library(dbplyr)
library(odbc)
library(DBI)
library(RPostgreSQL) 
```    
Now create a connection to the server using the `dbConnect` function. Using the `rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password")` function allows you to share code without sharing the password. **Never store your password in code!**

```
con <- dbConnect(odbc(),
                 Driver = "SQLServer",
                 Server = "mysqlhost",
                 Database = "mydbname",
                 UID = "myuser",
                 PWD = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password")
                 Port = 1433)
```

We have provided you with a test username and test password for this tutorial. This will allow you to test the connect and make sure you can access the data. There is official INTERACT data here. 
```{r]}
con <- dbConnect(odbc(),
                 Driver = "PostgreSQL",
                 Host = "yakitori.usask.ca",
                 Database = "interact_demo",
                 UID = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database user"),
                 PWD = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password"))
```
