## INTERACT Onboarding

> [Remember that there is no geek gene](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006023)

The purpose of this document is to orient and provide guidance for new trainees and collaborators involved with the INTERACT study. Our aim is to make your integration onto the team straight forward, action oriented, and to help you learn new skills. This document will likely take you between 2 and 3 days to work through. 

This onboarding document is divided into 4 sections: 
1. Glossary
2. R and RStudio
3. Database Connections in RStudio
4. Github

The goal is to point you to existing tutorials or training that will facilitate your work. It is important to remember that you will need to follow the tutorials in detail to get your head around what you are trying to do. Along with the tutorials we will ask that you do activities specific to INTERACT. We will try our best to acknowledge the great people who have contributed to the tutorials you are completing.
